This is a attempt to get Blazemod working again with CDDA Exprimental.

Forked from Kenan's Modpack, the most up to date version I could find.

Current target CDDA Experimental 2025-05-27-0430.

Status: Loads without errors or warning, but is otherwise untested

TODO: Finish updating recipies for the steel rework stuff.
